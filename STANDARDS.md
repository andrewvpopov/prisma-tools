# Shared Package Standards

Reference for every `andrewpopov/*` package consumed across bewks, stoki,
smarthome, sano-os, and kira (Kira epic BWK-84 / BWK-92). This repo
(`prisma-tools`) is the pilot; new package repos copy `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
and `scripts/verify-pack.mjs` from here and adjust the require-smoke.

## Distribution

- Install via git tag: `npm install github:andrewpopov/<pkg>#vX.Y.Z`.
  No npm org, no registry.
- **One package per repo.** The `github:` protocol installs the repo root.
- **Consumers pin a tag**, never a branch or a bare SHA. Upgrading a consumer =
  bump the tag in its `package.json` and reinstall.
- Standalone repo is the **source of truth**. No vendored copies in app repos;
  delete them when the app switches to the `github:` dependency.
- Keep runtime dependencies near zero (dotenv-class only). No framework deps in
  engine packages.

## Source & build

Two shapes, both valid:

1. **Trivial glue (this repo):** plain JS + a hand-written `index.d.ts`. No
   build step, no `dist/`. `main`/`types`/`bin` point at `src/`. Do not retrofit
   TypeScript onto a package this small.
2. **Non-trivial packages:** TypeScript source compiled with `tsc` to a
   **committed** `dist/`. `main`/`types` point at `dist/`. Committing the build
   output means `github:` installs need no install-time build (no `prepare`
   script, no consumer-side compile). CI guarantees the committed `dist/` is not
   stale (see below).

## Versioning & tags

- Semver. Bump `package.json` `version` and add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry in the
  same commit that you tag.
- **Tags are immutable.** Never move or delete a published tag — a moved tag
  silently poisons consumer lockfiles that resolved it. Fix forward with a new
  patch tag.
- Tag format `vX.Y.Z` (matches the `#vX.Y.Z` install ref).

## Branch protection (required on every repo)

`master` is protected so nothing lands without a PR whose CI is green. Apply to
each new package repo immediately after creating it:

```sh
gh api -X PUT repos/andrewpopov/<pkg>/branches/master/protection \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" --input - <<'JSON'
{
  "required_status_checks": { "strict": true, "contexts": ["test"] },
  "enforce_admins": true,
  "required_pull_request_reviews": { "required_approving_review_count": 0 },
  "restrictions": null,
  "allow_force_pushes": false,
  "allow_deletions": false
}
JSON
```

- `enforce_admins: true` — the owner goes through PRs too; no direct pushes to
  `master`.
- `required_approving_review_count: 0` — a solo owner can't approve their own PR,
  so requiring ≥1 would deadlock. The gate is "PR + green CI + owner clicks
  merge." If a second reviewer or a review bot is ever added, raise this to 1.

## CI (required before tagging)

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every PR and on `master`:

1. `npm ci`
2. `npm test` — unit tests.
3. **`npm run verify:pack`** — packs the tarball, installs it into a throwaway
   project, and requires it as a consumer would. Catches missing `files`, broken
   `main`/`types`/`bin`, and deps that only resolve inside the source tree.
4. **TS packages only:** `npm run build` then fail on a dirty `git diff --
   dist/`. This is what keeps the committed `dist/` honest against the TS source.

Never tag a commit whose CI is not green.

## Release checklist

`master` is protected (no direct pushes), so the version bump rides along in the
change PR — not a separate post-merge commit.

1. In the change PR, include the `version` bump + `CHANGELOG.md` entry.
2. Merge when CI is green.
3. `git tag vX.Y.Z <merge commit> && git push origin vX.Y.Z`. The tag-triggered
   `release-guard` CI job asserts the tag equals `package.json` version and has a
   CHANGELOG entry — if they drift, the tag build goes red. Tags are immutable;
   if a tag is wrong, cut the next patch tag rather than moving it.
4. In each consuming app: bump the `#vX.Y.Z` ref, reinstall, run the app's
   affected flow (see the app's adoption ticket), note the version in the app
   CHANGELOG.

## The Pi deploy failure mode

`npm ci` on the Raspberry Pi now reaches GitHub to resolve `github:` deps at
deploy time. `deploy-kit` (BWK-86) must prefer lockfile/offline-cache installs
and degrade gracefully when GitHub is unreachable, so a GitHub outage cannot
break a deploy that changes no dependencies.
